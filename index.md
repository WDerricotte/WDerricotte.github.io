My name is Wallace Derricotte and I am an assistant professor in the <a href="http://www.morehouse.edu/academics/chem/">Department of Chemistry</a> at <a href="http://morehouse.edu">Morehouse College</a> in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Atlanta,+GA/@33.7676338,-84.560694,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88f5045d6993098d:0x66fede2f990b630b!8m2!3d33.7489954!4d-84.3879824">Atlanta, GA</a>. This site serves as a hub for my professional blog, news on my scholarly activities, and course materials for my students. <br />

My primary research interest is the study of electronic excited states in molecular systems. More specifically, I use computational quantum chemistry methods to investigate the properties of electronic excitations. My early work was focused on developing time-independent density functional theory approaches for computation of high energy core excited states relevant for X-ray absorption spectroscopy. More recently, my research has expanded to developing new orbital representations to study the character of virtual orbitals in quantum chemistry calculations. 

Although the development of quantum chemistry methods involves extensive knowledge of quantum mechanics, applying and analyzing the results of such calculations are accesible to any chemistry student. Thus my research lends itself well to incorporating undergraduate students of all levels. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of quantum chemistry research students of math, physics, or even computer science may also be interested. If these types of problems spark your curiosity and you wish to undertake a research project with me, please stop by my office to let me know you are interested.
