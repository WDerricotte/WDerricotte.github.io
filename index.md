<font size="5">About</font>

We are a new computational chemistry group in the <a href="http://www.morehouse.edu/academics/chem/">Department of Chemistry</a> at <a href="http://morehouse.edu">Morehouse College</a> in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Atlanta,+GA/@33.7676338,-84.560694,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88f5045d6993098d:0x66fede2f990b630b!8m2!3d33.7489954!4d-84.3879824">Atlanta, GA</a>. Our research lies at the interface of chemistry, physics, and computer science. We develop and apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry">quantum chemistry</a> methods to novel chemical problems of interest. These methods exist in the form of computer algorithms that approximate solutions to the electronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation"> Schrodinger equation</a> in order to reveal information about the dynamics of electrons in molecules.    

Although the development of quantum chemistry methods involves extensive knowledge of quantum mechanics, applying and analyzing the results of such calculations are accesible to any student of the physical sciences. Thus our research lends itself well to incorporating undergraduate students of all levels. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of quantum chemistry research students of math, physics, or even computer science may also be interested. Please check back here for updates on our group and research. Highly motivated students are encourages to contact Dr. Derricotte if they are interested in pursuing an undergraduate research project.
