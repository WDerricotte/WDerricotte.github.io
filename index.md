We are a computational chemistry group in the <a href="http://www.morehouse.edu/academics/chem/">Department of Chemistry</a> at <a href="http://morehouse.edu">Morehouse College</a> in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Atlanta,+GA/@33.7676338,-84.560694,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88f5045d6993098d:0x66fede2f990b630b!8m2!3d33.7489954!4d-84.3879824">Atlanta, GA</a>. We focus on the development and application of modern computational methods to study geometric and electronic structure of molecules. More specifically we are interested in studying organic molecules useful for applications in organic electronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Fabrication of efficient devices involves deep insight into the chemistry of these materials. Knowledge of their reactivity, stability, charge carrier properties are things we can probe with the aid of computational tools.  

Although the development of quantum chemistry methods involves extensive knowledge of quantum mechanics, applying and analyzing the results of such calculations are accesible to any student of the physical sciences. Thus our research lends itself well to incorporating undergraduate students of all levels. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of quantum chemistry research students of math, physics, or even computer science may also be interested. Please check back here for updates on our group and research. Highly motivated students are encourages to contact Dr. Derricotte if they are interested in pursuing an undergraduate research project.
