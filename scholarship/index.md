My primary research interest is the study of electronic excited states in molecular systems. More specif
ically, I use computational quantum chemistry methods to investigate the properties of electronic excita
tions. My early work was focused on developing time-independent density functional theory approaches for
 computation of high energy core excited states relevant for X-ray absorption spectroscopy. More recentl
y, my research has expanded to developing new orbital representations to study the character of virtual
orbitals in quantum chemistry calculations.

Although the development of quantum chemistry methods involves extensive knowledge of quantum mechanics,
 applying and analyzing the results of such calculations are accesible to any chemistry student. Thus my
 research lends itself well to incorporating undergraduate students of all levels. Due to the interdisci
plinary nature of quantum chemistry research students of math, physics, or even computer science may als
o be interested. If these types of problems spark your curiosity and you wish to undertake a research pr
oject with me, please stop by my office to let me know you are interested.
