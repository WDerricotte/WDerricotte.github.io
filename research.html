<h3>Overview<h3>
<p>Our goal is to gain a better understanding of chemical reactions and molecular properties through the use and/or development of computational chemistry methods. Our brand of chemistry research may differ drastically from what you might envision a chemists does. Rather than don a chrisp white lab coat and rush into a lab mixing dangerous chemicals together, we stay safe behind the comfort of our computers writing algorithms and running calculations to better understand the physical nature of chemistry. Specifically, my group is interested in reaction mechanisms and better understanding how fundamental molecular forces help to drive or impede chemical reactions. Check out the descriptions below to learn more about our work. Highly motivated undergraduate students in the Atlanta University Center who are interested in doing research with us, are encouraged to contact Dr. Derricotte directly. </p>
<h3>Toward New Insights Into Chemical Reaction Mechanisms<h3>

<p>Over the past 10-15 years, reaction force analysis has proven to be a useful tool to analyze chemical reactions. The reaction force provides a natural partitioning of the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) into regions corresponding to the reactants, transition state, and products based on the extrema of the force. Since it is a classically defined quantity, the force naturally gives rise to reaction works and reaction force constants. Traditional methods to decompose the reaction force are based on a supermolecular approach to calculating the interaction energy, our group is currently exploring perturbational approaches as an alternative method of decomposing the reaction force.</p>

<h3>Developing Open-Source Software For Reaction Analysis<h3>

<p>Our group is actively developing an open-source library to efficiently calculate molecular energies and properties along a reaction coordinate. This code is codenamed pyREX (python Reaction Energy eXtension), the code is currently in a private Github repository but we plan to make the code publicly available in 2019...STAY TUNED!</p>
