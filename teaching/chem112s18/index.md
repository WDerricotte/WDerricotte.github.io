## Welcome ##
Welcome to the course web page for the Fall 2017 class of CHE 111: Elementary Inorganic Chemistry I at [Morehouse College](http://morehouse.edu). The links above may be very useful to you throughout the semester. There you will find a PDF copy of the syllabus, a repository of any related course materials, and homework problem sets. Also I will update the site with a short (two or three sentence) lecture recap describing what was covered in class during that day. Very useful if you miss class or just need a reminder of the last topic discussed.

## What is This Course All About? ##
Part of a two-semester course sequence (111/112), Chemistry 111 provides an overview of the different sub-disciplines of chemistry. This course is designed to give the aspiring scientist/engineer a firm foundation in chemistry with which to begin his/her technical career. This course will demonstrate to students the importance and impact that both science and chemistry, in particular, have on society. Students will be introduced to the basic tools of chemistry, experimentation and measurement (as they relate to the three common states of matter), as well as basic chemical nomenclature and reactivity types. Topics covered include elementary structure of atoms and molecules, chemical reactions, stoichiometry, introduction to quantum chemistry, phases of matter and phase changes, and thermodynamics.
