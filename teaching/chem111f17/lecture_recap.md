## Week 1 ##
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, August 16th, 2017:</b> First day of classes here at Morehouse! After a quick overview of the syllabus we discussed what makes chemistry a <q> Central Science </q> making connections to familiar developments in other fields of study. We discussed the scientific method, accuracy vs. precision, and introduced the rules for determining the number of significant figures in a reported value. We ended class by taking a stab at several examples for determining sig figs. </li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, August 18th, 2017:</b> Covered quite a few topics today. Class began with a review of significant figures in math operations and dimensional analysis. Then we introduced the concepts of temperature and density. The first Problem Set was distributed as well, keep in mind it is due next Friday and your first quiz is next week Wednesday.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, August 21st, 2017:</b> Today we learned how to classify matter based on its physical and chemical properties. We reviewed the classic Thomson and Rutherford experiements that lead to our modern view of atomic structure.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017:</b> Quiz day! Following the quiz we continued our discussion of modern atomic structure. We discussed ions and isotopes and practiced labeling these atoms properly and identifying the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons. We began to discuss chemical bonding and the important role that electrons play in this process.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, August 25th, 2017:</b> Molecules are a collection of atoms...but how do they form? We discussed covalent and ionic bonding. The fundamental laws of chemistry were introduced with special attention to the Law of Multiple Proportions.</li>
</ul> 

## Week 3 ##
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, August 28th, 2017:</b> Today we introduced the concept of the mole and its relation to Avogadros number. We practiced this concept by solving some dimensional analysis problems using this new dimension. </li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, August 30th, 2017:</b> Quiz today covered atomic structure and the law of multiple proportions. (Hope you learned something about the thorium fuel cycle!) During the lecture we introduced molecular mass and began to use this in dimensional analysis problems.
</ul>
