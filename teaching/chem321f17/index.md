## Welcome ##
Welcome to the course web page for the Fall 2017 class of CHEM 321: Physical Chemistry I at [Morehouse College](http://morehouse.edu). The links above may be very useful to you throughout the semester. There you will find a PDF copy of the syllabus, a repository of any related course materials, and homework problem sets. Also I will update the site with a short (two or three sentence) lecture recap describing what was covered in class during that day. Very useful if you miss class or just need a reminder of the last topic discussed.

## What is This Course All About? ##
Part of a two-semester course sequence (321/322), Chemistry 321 is a physical chemistry course that relies heavily on your understanding and recall of the general chemical principles first presented in the introductory course sequence (111/112). Physical chemistry can be broadly defined as the application of physics to chemistry. The physics serves a guide with which we can build various models to explain chemical phenomena. These models include the kinetic theory of gases, collision theory of reactions, etc. The construction of these physical models requires the support of mathematics. Thus, physical chemistry is an inherently mathematical subject matter and can be conceived faster through practice exercises and problem solving. Many problems will be assigned in this course through weekly problem sets, however it is encouraged that students seek to solve as many end-of-chapter problems as possible. 321 specifically focuses on quantitative problem solving in chemical thermodynamices and kinetics. More detailed theoretical insight will be gained about familiar chemistry conceptes such as the ideal gas law, entropy, enthalpy, calorimetry, temperature, and catalysis. Students will harness the ability to solve complex problems in these areas and learn to approach chemical problems based on physical insight.
