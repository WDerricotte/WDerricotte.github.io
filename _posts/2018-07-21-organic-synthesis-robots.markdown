description: Review of recent work detailing the use of organic synthesis robots.

As a theoretician, I humbly concede that organic synthesis is one of the most impactful sub-disciplines of the chemical sciences. It is one of the last lines of defense between an interesting idea becoming a new reality. While theory is primarily the foundation that motivates these discoveries, synthesis is what drives them forward. Anything that can increase the productivity of organic synthesis is a good thing for the field, and <a href="http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/">Leroy Cronin</a> at the University of Glasgow in the UK may have provided a huge boom to the field.

Cronin and his research group (he has to call them his cronies right?) have utilized the aide of an organic synthesis robot driven by machine learning in order to increase productivity in finding new reactions. Machine learning is a hot field that has had far reaching applications, yet its application to chemistry is still relatively unexplored. By utilizing machine learning these "Robo-Chemists" were able to learn which reactions were likely to be effective through data rather than being programmed. But fear-not organic chemists, these robots are not taking your jobs. They are simply used to navigate the chemical reaction space and identify likely synthetic targets more effectively. An actual human chemists still has to come in and manually follow-up these reactions. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0307-8">first study</a> using these robots was able to identify four new reactions. This application of machine learning will surely revolutionize all fields of chemistry, and maybe even all facets of our everyday life.
