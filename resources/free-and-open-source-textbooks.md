Here is a (partial) list of free and/or open-source textbooks. If you find one of these more helpful than another, please <a href="mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu">let me know</a>. Also, take a peek at [Rob Beezer’s](http://buzzard.ups.edu) selection on [this page](http://linear.ups.edu/curriculum.html). Moreover, the [American Institute of Mathematics](http://www.aimath.org) maintains a list of [approved open-source textbooks](http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/).

### Calculus ###
  * [APEX Calclus](http://www.apexcalculus.com) is an open-source textbook by a group of faculty from Virginia Military Institute.  It has the look and feel of a traditional calculus (e.g., Stewart's *Calculus*). Includes interactive 3D graphics.
  * [MOOCulus Textbook](https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts) is a free textbook from the [MOOCulus](https://mooculus.osu.edu/) folks at Ohio State University. This text is mostly an adaptation of the Community Calculus text listed below.
  * [Community Calculus](http://communitycalculus.org) by [David Guichard](http://skink.whitman.edu/~guichard/) (Whitman College). This one is also available as a free PDF. You can also purchase a very inexpensive hardcopy from [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/whitmancalculus).
  * [Active Calculus](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html) by [Matt Boelkins](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/MB.html) (Grand Valley State College). This is one of the newer additions to the list of free calculus texts.
  * [Calculus](http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/) by [Gilbert Strang](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/) (MIT). This book is available as a free PDF from the [MIT Open Courseware Project](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). There are also some corresponding videos, which can be found [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/high-school/courses/highlights-of-calculus/index.htm).
  * [Calculus Refresher](http://www.math.umn.edu/~garrett/calculus/) by [Paul Garrett](http://www.math.umn.edu/~garrett/index.shtml) (University of Minnesota). Another free PDF. This short book seems designed for students who have had some experience with calculus and need some review.
  * [Funny Little Calculus Text](http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/FLCT/index.html) by [Robert Ghrist](http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/index.html) (University of Pennsylvania). Currently only first semester calculus, very short, and no exercises, but a free PDF.
  * [Paul’s Online Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) by [Paul Dawkins](http://www.math.lamar.edu/faculty/dawkins/dawkins.aspx) (Lamar University). Paul's notes cover Calculus 1-3, Linear Algebra, and more. The notes are available as free HTML-based material. These notes seem to be popular with students.
  * [Differential Calculus with Sage](http://wdjoyner.com/teach/calc1-sage/) by [David Joyner](http://wdjoyner.com/) (United States Naval Academy) and Granville. This free book is available as either a PDF or in HTML form. The book covers first semester calculus and incorporates [Sage](http://sagemath.org), which is an open-source mathematics software package.
  * [Integral Calculus with Sage](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/teaching/calc2-sage/) by [Dale Hoffman](http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/) (Bellevue Community College), [William Stein](http://modular.math.washington.edu/) (University of Washington), and [David Joyner](http://wdjoyner.com/) (United States Naval Academy). The book picks up where the previous book left off.
  * [Contemporary Calculus](http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/Calculus_all/Calculus_all.html) by [Dale Hoffman](http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/) (Bellevue Community College).  A free online calculus text that is being developed for the [Open Course Library Project of the Washington State Colleges](http://opencourselibrary.org).  This book is part of the foundation for the previous book.  It covers three semesters of calculus and seems to do a thorough job of it, but the formatting is awful.

### Differential Equations ###

  * [Introductory Differential Equations using Sage](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/teaching/DiffyQ/des-book.pdf) (PDF) by [David Joyner]((http://wdjoyner.com/)) (United State Naval Academy).
